## Overview

This is my javascript quiz project on fast food, I have included many questions in my quiz about some of the things you would think about when ordering food from a fast food restuarant, To make my quiz challenging I put very specific questions in the quiz so its not completley obvious what the answer is. The user first loads onto the introduction section with infomation about the quiz then the user should press the to quiz button which will take them to the quiz, they will then select one answer out of a list of answer to each question for this I have used radio tags, then when the user is done they click the submit button below the quiz to find out their results, and on the result section they have their result and buttons to either retry the quiz or go back to the home page. 

## User Experience

Navigation through the page is made easy with buttons that can take to you each section on the introduction page theres a button to load the quiz page, when the user is finished the quiz they are given two buttons one to reload the quiz page so they can retry the quiz, the other one to take the user back to the home section giving the user smooth navigation through my quiz website. The color scheme is pink, white, red and black each question is made to resemble a menu board with a white background, black border and pretty font for a lively appearance this is to somewhat remind the user of being at a fast food restuarant. I changed the cursor to a pointer on all buttons and radio buttons when the user hovers over them to give an interactive experience. Each time the user completes the quiz they get a certain message based on their score they can get one of three messages "Excellent Go you!" for a result over 7, "Good! Keep it up" for a result between 4-7 and "You should really know more than this" when the result is less than 4 this is to make the user react to this and want to try harder or feel good if they got a good result.

## Testing

I made sure to test my website each time I made a change on my file to see if it was still functional by opening my html files on a browser, so I could be presented with the output results of my code so I could what worked and what didnt, I usually did this before putting my code into online validators. Here are more details of the websites I used below.

### Validation

I also ran my code through online validation tools to ensure I was using correct syntax in all my files and using the best way to write all my code, this helped to correct me if I made any errors which would affect the website output, making sure it could actually work when the user loads the page. This gave me tips if I went wrong with my code for example if I was writing my html file and not putting things in the right containers.

## Technology

I used Visual studio code as my editor to write all my code in and create all my local files on my machine.

The browser I used to open my files on an online output was Microsoft edge, this is the default browser that all my files were saved with.

I used Git and Github as a version control system to upload all my files to the internet and allow other users to collaborate with me on my project, also to keep all my work on there in case I wanted to go back to previous versions of my project. I used to push to my commitments to my project from my local machine to the Github website where others could view my files as well as make changes to them if they wanted to collaborate with me.
