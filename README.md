# Java
## Overview
This is my javascript quiz project on fast food, I have included many questions in my quiz about some of the things you would think about when ordering food from a fast food restuarant.
## User Experience
## Testing
### Validation
I also ran my code through online validation tools to ensure I was using correct syntax in all my files and using the best way to write all my code, this helped to correct me if I made any errors which would affect the website output, making sure it could actually work when the user loads the page. This gave me tips if I went wrong with my code for example if I was writing my html file and not putting things in the right containers.

## Technology

I used Visual studio code as my editor to write all my code in and create all files on my machine.

I used Git and Github as a version control system to upload all my files to the internet and allow other users to collaborate with me on my project, also to keep all my work on there in case I wanted to go back to previous versions of my project. I used to push to my commitments to my project from my local machine to the Github website.
